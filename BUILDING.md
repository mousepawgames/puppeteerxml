# Building PuppeteerXML

Building Basics
----------------------
CMake is used to build PuppeteerXML. For your convenience,
we've included Makefiles to automate all common build scenarios on Linux.
Type "make" in the root of this repository for more information.

At this time, the Makefiles are only designed for Linux. If you are building
on another system, you can interact with CMake directly.

Currently, PuppeteerXML is only designed to be built by GCC (5.3 or later) or
Clang (3.4 or later).

## Building and Linking Dependencies

PuppeteerXML relies on CPGF, PawLIB, and pugixml. The build system's default
behavior is to look for MousePaw Games' `pawlib-git/` and `lib-git/` repositories,
cloned parallel to this repository's main folder. Simply run `make ready` in each
of those repositories before building this one.
(This is our default for company development environments.)

You can specify custom paths for these libraries by creating a ".config" file
in the root of this repository. Make a copy of "build.config.txt" and save it
with the ending ".config". See that file for more information.

## Ready-To-Use Build

If you just want to build PuppeteerXML to use in your own project, the fastest way
is to run "make ready". This will build PuppeteerXML and its documentation,
and place them all in a folder called "puppeteerxml". Simply copy that folder to
a convenient location, and point your compiler and linker to "puppeteerxml/include"
and "puppeteerxml/lib" respectively.

## Building HTML Docs

If you want the HTML documentation, run "make docs". Then, grab the 'docs/build/html'
folder, or just open 'docs/build/html/index.html' in your favorite web browser.

For more documentation formats, see the Makefile in 'docs/'.

## Building Tester

If you want to test out PuppeteerXML directly, run "make tester". Then, look
for the puppeteerxml-tester executable in tester/bin/[Debug/Release].

## Code::Blocks

PuppeteerXML was written and built in CodeBlocks. The projects (.cbp) in this
repository are pre-configured to build directly in the repository.

## Source Directories

- The '/docs' folder contains the Sphinx documentation for PuppeteerXML.
- The '/library' folder contains the source code for the PuppeteerXML
  library.
- The '/tester' folder contains the console application for testing
  the PuppeteerXML library.
