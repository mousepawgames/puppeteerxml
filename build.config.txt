# Specify the paths to the dependencies here.

# NOTE: ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY} is a special variable which points to
# either the 'library/' or 'tester/' folder, depending on which one is
# being built. Relative paths should always begin with this variable,
# and should be relative to either of those folders.

##### PAWLIB & CPGF #####

# The path to PawLIB and CPGF.
# The build system will look for 'lib/' and 'include/' at this location.

set(PAWLIB_DIR
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../pawlib-git/pawlib
)

# The default is '${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../pawlib-git/pawlib', which
# assumes a copy of the pawlib git repository in the same directory as this
# repository folder.
# 'make ready' would need to be run in that repository to generate the
# library.



##### XERCES #####

# The path to Xerces-C++.
# The build system will look for '.libs/' and 'xercesc/' at this location.

set(XERCES_DIR
    ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../xerces/src
)

# By default, Xerces-C++ 3.1 lives in this repository at
# '${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../xerces/src'.
# 'make xerces' would need to be run from the root of this repository to
# generate the library.
